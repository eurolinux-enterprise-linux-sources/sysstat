 The variables and their meanings are:
 .TP
+.B COMPRESSAFTER
+Number of days after which daily data files are to be compressed.
+The compression program is given in the
+.B ZIP
+variable.
+
+.TP
 .B HISTORY
 The number of days during which a daily data file or a report
 should be kept. Data files or reports older than this number of
 days will be removed by the
 .BR sa2 (8)
 shell script.
+Data files and reports are normally saved in the @SA_DIR@ directory,
+under the name
+.IR saDD
+(for data files) or
+.IR sarDD
+(for reports), where the DD parameter indicates the current day.
 
-.TP
-.B COMPRESSAFTER
-Number of days after which daily data files are to be compressed,
-either by gzip or bzip2.
+The number of files actually kept in the @SA_DIR@ directory may be
+slightly higher than the
+.B HISTORY
+value due to the way the
+.B sa2
+script figures
+out which files are to be removed (see below "How the
+.BR sa2 (8)
+script applies
+.B HISTORY
+value"). Using a value of 28 keeps a whole month's worth of data.
+
+How the
+.BR sa2 (8)
+script applies
+.B HISTORY
+value
+
+The
+.B sa2
+script uses the "find" command with the "-mtime" option to figure
+out which files are to be removed. The "find" command interprets this value
+as "N 24 hour periods", ignoring any fractional part. This means that the
+last modified time of a given sa[r]DD data or report file, using a
+.B HISTORY
+of 1, has to have been modified at least two days ago before it will be
+removed. And for a
+.B HISTORY
+of 28 that would mean 29 days ago.
+
+To figure out how a
+.B HISTORY
+of 28 is applied in practice, we need to
+consider that the
+.B sa2
+script that issues the "find" command to remove the
+old files typically runs just before mid-night on a given system, and since
+the first record from
+.B sadc
+can also be written to the previous day's data file
+(thereby moving its modification time up a bit), the
+.B sa2
+script will leave
+30 files untouched. So for a setting of 28, and counting the data file of
+the current day, there will always be 31 files (or 30 files, depending on the
+number of days in a month) in the @SA_DIR@ directory during the majority
+of a given day.  E.g.:
+
+April 30th: 31 files (Apr 30th-1st, Mar 31th)
+.br
+May 1st: 30 files (May 1st, Apr 30th-2nd)
+
+Yet we can note the following exceptions (as inspected at Noon of the given
+day):
+
+February 28th: 31 files (Feb 28th-1st, Jan 31st, 30th & 29th)
+.br
+March 1st: 30 files (Mar 1st, Feb 28th-2nd, Jan 31st & 30th)
+.br
+March 2nd: 29 files (Mar 1st & 2nd, Feb 28th-3rd, Jan. 31st)
+.br
+March 3rd: 28 files (Mar 1st-3rd, Feb 28th-4th)
+.br
+March 4th - March 28th: 28 files
+.br
+March 29th: 29 files
+.br
+March 30th: 30 files
+.br
+March 31st: 31 files
+
+(Determining the number of files in March on a leap year is left as an
+exercise for the reader).
